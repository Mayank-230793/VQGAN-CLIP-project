## **Overview**  
This project is designed to develop modular AI building blocks leveraging generative AI technologies. It integrates advanced API calls to create flexible and reusable components for applications like image generation, text completion, and more.

VQGAN stands for Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network, while CLIP stands for Contrastive Image-Language Pretraining. Whenever we say VQGAN-CLIP1, we refer to the interaction between these two networks. They’re separate models that work in tandem. The way they work is that VQGAN generates the images, while CLIP judges how well an image matches our text prompt. This interaction guides our generator to produce more accurate images.

CLIP guides VQGAN towards an image that is the best match to a given text. CLIP is the “Perceptor” and VQGAN is the “Generator”. VQGAN like all GANs VQGAN takes in a noise vector, and outputs a (realistic) image. CLIP on the other hand takes in an image and text, and outputs the image features and text features respectively. The similarity between image and text can be represented by the cosine similarity of the learnt feature vectors.

By leveraging CLIPs capacities as a “steering wheel”, we can use CLIP to guide a search through VQGAN’s latent space to find images that match a text prompt very well according to CLIP.
